# Snake Game - Gitspert25 Edition 🐍🚀

Welcome to the **Snake Game** coded with pure HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, and JavaScript! This classic game lets you control a growing snake to eat food without hitting yourself.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to move the snake around the grid.
- Eat the food (orange icon) to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid running into the snake’s own body — if you do, the game ends.
- Press the **Restart** button after game over to play again.
